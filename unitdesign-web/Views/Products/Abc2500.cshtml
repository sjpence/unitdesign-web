        <p class="lead">
            Unit Design's broad range of Aqueous Batch Cleaners enable the customer to clean printed circuit boards removing rosin, water soluble and no-clean fluxes. The ABC series is also capable of removing dirt,
            cutting oils, and contaminants from a variety of manufactured components. The results of this cleaning process meet all military and commercial specifications. The ABC series of cleaners can be customized
            to meet all of your cleaning needs. Units may be fully or partially closed-loop. Options include wash water recycling, rinse water recycling or both. De-ionized water systems are also available. For your
            water only applications, we offer a completely closed loop unit.

                    <h3>Industrial</h3>
                    <p>The ABC-2500 is designed from the ground up for an industrial cleaning process, unlike many other batch cleaners which are built using a dishwasher or lab glasswasher as a base.</p>
                    <h3>Durable</h3>
                    <p>
                        The cleaning chamber of the ABC Series is constructed from thick 16 gage 304 stainless steel, as opposed to the thin stainless steel of a residential dishwasher or lab glasswasher.  This along with a door
                        designed for industrial use will ensure many years of service from the system.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Powerful</h3>
                    <p>A high flow, medium pressure spray system provides both the high flow rates desired for many of the most popular cleaning chemicals and enough pressure to remove contaminants without damaging sensitive boards.</p>

                    <h3>Open Loop</h3>
                    <p>
                        All ABC Series Batch Cleaner models come standard with a feeder pump capable of metering cleaning chemical directly into the cleaning chamber.  This allows for easy startup of a cleaning process, quick
                        chemical testing and also injection of rinse aids.  Chemical injected this way is sent to drain creating an open loop cleaning process.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Closed Loop</h3>
                    <p>
                        The available Wash Water Recycling System allows the use of a closed loop washing process.  The cleaning chemical solution is stored in a heated tank for reuse over and over.  This provides substantial chemical
                        cost savings.  Once the recommended use period is over, the tank is drained and the machine automatically refills the tank with the programmed mixture of chemical and water.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Compatible</h3>
                    <p>The stainless steel plumbing of the ABC Series provides for compatibility with all of the common aqueous cleaning chemicals used in the electronics industry.</p>

                    <h2>Water Heating</h2>
                    <p>
                        The ABC series is equipped with a built-in water heating system. Water enters the machine and is pre-heated with the 18,000 watt on-demand heater and is then transferred into the cleaning chamber sump. In the sump,
                        a separate 6,000 watt heater holds the wash or rinse water at the precise user programmed temperature. This system enables the use of heated rinse cycles, which are recommended by most cleaning chemistry
                        manufacturers. Also, by heating the water as it is needed, the user can program different temperatures for each step of the cleaning process.

                    <h2>Water Recycling</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Rinse Water Recycling (RWR) system reduces or even eliminates the need to send your rinse water to drain. This reduces the load on an evaporator or waste treatment system, reducing operating and energy
                        costs. This is an excellent choice when you are using water soluble fluxes as the system is completely closed loop. The RWR can clean the rinse water (in the case of R, RA, RMA or No-Clean fluxes) or both
                        the wash and rinse water in the case of OA fluxes.

                    <p>
                        The ABC Series provides a fast, efficient forced air flow with temperatures up to 250 &deg;F (120 &deg;C), providing uniform drying throughout the cleaning chamber. Engineered with a cross ventilation design, the
                        ABC-2500 has the most effective drying system in the aqueous batch cleaning market today.
